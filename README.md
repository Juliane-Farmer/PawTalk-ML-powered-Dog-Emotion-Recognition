Dogs have a lot to say, but their emotions often remain a mystery. In this project, Iâ€™ve developed a system that translates dog emotions into human language using  Raspberry Pi, machine learning knowledge and a LCD display.

Let's take a step forward in understanding our beloved pets and improving our communication with them.
